# JHU-NIST Hackathon: PnP Group

In August 2025, NIST and JHU organized a hackathon: [Building Bridges for Better Self-Driving Laboratory Software](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2025/08/hackathon-building-bridges-better-self-driving-laboratory-software)

During the hackathon, groups were formed. This repository represents the work of the group who worked on plug-and-play (PnP) for self-driving labs. 

The members of this group included:

- Abdulazeez Mohammed Salim (JHU)
- Daniel Sauceda (NIST)
- Jon Hollenbach (JHU)
